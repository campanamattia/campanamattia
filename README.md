### HELLO!
My name is Mattia Campana and I am studying Computer Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano.
As an aspiring computer security professional, I am particularly interested in the development and implementation of secure systems that can withstand cyber attacks. I believe that my studies in computer engineering will provide me with the necessary technical skills to tackle the complex challenges of cybersecurity and make a meaningful contribution to this field.
